### Normalcy Bias

"Normalcy bias" refers to a cognitive bias that causes individuals to underestimate or ignore the possibility of a disaster or crisis occurring, simply because things have been normal or stable for a long time. It leads people to believe that things will always continue as they have been, despite evidence or signs suggesting otherwise.

### Bias (バイアス)

"Bias" refers to a tendency or inclination towards a particular perspective, outlook, or inclination, often to the detriment of objectivity. It involves prejudice in favor of or against a thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way that is considered unfair. Bias can affect decisions, judgments, and behaviors, leading to a lack of impartiality or neutrality.

1. Cognitive Bias: These are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, where individuals create their own "subjective reality" based on perception.

2. Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

3. Implicit Bias: Also known as unconscious bias, these are attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.

4. Selection Bias: A distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data is collected.
