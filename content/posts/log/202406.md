### GPIO Pins

General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins are versatile, programmable pins found on microcontrollers and single-board computers. They are used to interface with a wide range of electronic components and devices.

- Input/Output: GPIO pins can be configured either as inputs, to read data from external devices (such as sensors), or as outputs, to send data to external devices (such as LEDs or motors).

- Digital Signals: Typically, GPIO pins work with digital signals, which means they can recognize or send only two states: HIGH (1) or LOW (0). This binary nature allows them to work with a variety of digital devices and components.

### Normalcy Bias

"Normalcy bias" refers to a cognitive bias that causes individuals to underestimate or ignore the possibility of a disaster or crisis occurring, simply because things have been normal or stable for a long time. It leads people to believe that things will always continue as they have been, despite evidence or signs suggesting otherwise.

### Bias

"Bias" refers to a tendency or inclination towards a particular perspective, outlook, or inclination, often to the detriment of objectivity. It involves prejudice in favor of or against a thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way that is considered unfair. Bias can affect decisions, judgments, and behaviors, leading to a lack of impartiality or neutrality.

- Cognitive Bias: These are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, where individuals create their own "subjective reality" based on perception.

- Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

- Implicit Bias: Also known as unconscious bias, these are attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.

- Selection Bias: A distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data is collected.
