### Lifecycle of a Class Instance in Python

#### `__new__`

1. Instance Creation
- Purpose: Allocate memory for the new instance.
- Invocation: Called when a new instance is created.
- Signature: __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)

``` py
class MyClass:
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Creating instance")
        instance = super(MyClass, cls).__new__(cls)
        return instance
```

#### `__init__`

2. Instance Initialization
- Purpose: Initialize the instance (set up instance attributes).
- Invocation: Called after the instance has been created.
- Signature: __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

``` py
class MyClass:    
    def __init__(self, name):
        print("Initializing instance")
        self.name = name
```

#### `__del__`

3. Instance Deletion
- Purpose: Clean up resources before the instance is destroyed.
- Invocation: Called when an instance is about to be destroyed.
- Signature: __del__(self)

``` py
class MyClass:
    def __del__(self):
        print("Destroying instance")
```

### String Representation of an Object in Python

#### `__str__`

The __str__ method is meant to provide a "pretty" or user-friendly string representation of an object. It's typically used for displaying the object to end-users.
- Usage: str(obj) or print(obj)
- Goal: Readable and easy to understand by end-users.

``` py
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"MyClass(name={self.name}, age={self.age})"
```

#### `__repr__`

The __repr__ method is meant to provide a more precise and unambiguous string representation of an object, ideally one that could be used to recreate the object. It is used for debugging and development.
- Usage: Itâ€™s often useful to define both __str__ and __repr__ for your classes, with __repr__ providing a more detailed, developer-oriented string and __str__ providing a simpler, user-oriented string.
- Goal: Detailed and unambiguous, useful for developers.

``` py
class MyClass:
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyClass(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})"
```

### Custom Behavior for Comparison

#### `__eq__`

The __eq__ method is used to define the behavior for the equality operator (==). When you use == to compare two objects, Python internally calls the __eq__ method.
- Purpose: Define custom equality comparison between instances of a class.
- Signature: __eq__(self, other)

``` py
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, MyClass):
            return self.name == other.name and self.age == other.age
        return False

obj1 = MyClass("Alice", 30)
obj2 = MyClass("Bob", 25)

print(obj1 == obj2)
```

#### Other Comparison Methods

- `__ne__`(self, other) for !=
- `__le__`(self, other) for <=
- `__gt__`(self, other) for >
- `__ge__`(self, other) for >=

### Context Management Protocol in Python

#### `__enter__`

The __enter__ method is called when the execution flow enters the context of the with statement. It typically initializes or acquires some resources (e.g., opening a file or acquiring a lock) and returns an object that will be used within the with block.

- Purpose: Set up resources needed within the context.
- Signature: __enter__(self)

#### `__exit__`

The __exit__ method is called when the execution flow exits the context of the with statement. It is responsible for cleaning up or releasing the resources that were set up in the __enter__ method. It takes three arguments that provide information about any exception that occurred within the with block.

- Purpose: Clean up resources when the context is exited.
- Signature: __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)

#### Example

``` py
class MyResource:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")
        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"An exception of type {exc_type} occurred with value: {exc_value}")
        return False

    def do_something(self):
        print("Doing something with the resource")

with MyResource() as resource:
    resource.do_something()
    raise ValueError("An error occurred")

print("Outside the context")
```

Output:

``` sh
Entering the context
Doing something with the resource
Exiting the context
Outside the context
```

If an exception is raised inside the with block, the __exit__ method is called with the exception details. You can choose to handle the exception within __exit__ and return True to suppress it, or return False to let it propagate.

### Memory Management

#### Page Table

1. Translation Mechanism

- Each process running on a PC has its own page table, maintained by the OS.
- The page table maps virtual addresses to physical address.

2. Page Table Entries

- The page table consists of a series of entries, with each entry corresponding to a page of virtual memory.
- Each entry typically contains information such as:
    - Virtual page number
    - Physical page number
    - Additional control bits

3. Translation Process

- When a program references a virtual memory address, the CPU uses the MMU (memory management unit) to look up the corresponding entry in the page table.
- The MMU retrieves the physical address from the page table entry and uses it to access the actual data in physical RAM.

4. Handling Page Faults

- If a program references a virtual page that is not currently in physical memory which due to swapping or initial loading, a page fault occurs.
- The OS handles page faults by:
    - Bringing the required page from disk into RAM (page in)
    - Updating the page table entry to reflect the new physical location.
    - Resuming execution of the program.

### Memory Management Unit

Translates virtual addresses used by programs into physical address in RAM.

1. Address Translation

- Virtual Addresses: Programs use virtual memory addresses, which are independent of RAM layout and provide a uniform address space for each process.
- Physical Addresses: RAM stores actual data and instructions that the CPU accesses directly.
- The MMU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses, allowing the CPU to access the correct data in RAM.

2. Page Table Lookup

- Each process running on the OS has its own page table, managed by the OS.
- Whe na program references a virtual memory address, the MMU uses the page table to look up the corresponding physical address.

3. TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)

- To speed up address translation, the MMU often includes a small, high-speed cache called the TLB.
- The TLB stores recently used virtual-to-physical address mappings, reducing the need to access the full page table for every memory access.
- If the virtual address is found in the TLB (TLB hit), the corresponding physical address is retrieved quickly.
- If the virtual address is not in the TLB (TLB miss), the MMU accesses the page table to find the physical address, updates the TLB with the new mapping, and then retrieves the physical address.
