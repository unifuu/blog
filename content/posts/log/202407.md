### Memory Management

#### Page Table

1. Translation Mechanism

- Each process running on a PC has its own page table, maintained by the OS.
- The page table maps virtual addresses to physical address.

2. Page Table Entries

- The page table consists of a series of entries, with each entry corresponding to a page of virtual memory.
- Each entry typically contains information such as:
    - Virtual page number
    - Physical page number
    - Additional control bits

3. Translation Process

- When a program references a virtual memory address, the CPU uses the MMU (memory management unit) to look up the corresponding entry in the page table.
- The MMU retrieves the physical address from the page table entry and uses it to access the actual data in physical RAM.

4. Handling Page Faults

- If a program references a virtual page that is not currently in physical memory which due to swapping or initial loading, a page fault occurs.
- The OS handles page faults by:
    - Bringing the required page from disk into RAM (page in)
    - Updating the page table entry to reflect the new physical location.
    - Resuming execution of the program.

### Memory Management Unit

Translates virtual addresses used by programs into physical address in RAM.

1. Address Translation

- Virtual Addresses: Programs use virtual memory addresses, which are independent of RAM layout and provide a uniform address space for each process.
- Physical Addresses: RAM stores actual data and instructions that the CPU accesses directly.
- The MMU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses, allowing the CPU to access the correct data in RAM.

2. Page Table Lookup

- Each process running on the OS has its own page table, managed by the OS.
- Whe na program references a virtual memory address, the MMU uses the page table to look up the corresponding physical address.

3. TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)

- To speed up address translation, the MMU often includes a small, high-speed cache called the TLB.
- The TLB stores recently used virtual-to-physical address mappings, reducing the need to access the full page table for every memory access.
- If the virtual address is found in the TLB (TLB hit), the corresponding physical address is retrieved quickly.
- If the virtual address is not in the TLB (TLB miss), the MMU accesses the page table to find the physical address, updates the TLB with the new mapping, and then retrieves the physical address.
